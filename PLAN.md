# Implementation Plan (High-Level)

- **Implementation stack**: ✅ Go (target macOS + Linux equally, statically linked binaries). Assume latest stable Go toolchain (≥1.22) with modules.
- **Agent strategy**: need to build agent shims from scratch; initial implementation wraps Claude Code via CLI (`claude` on `$PATH`). Roles passed via CLI prompt interpolation (e.g., `claude "You are the $ROLE agent"`); design shims so alternative CLIs can be swapped in later.
- **Workspace baseline**: ✅ greenfield repository.
- **Platform priority**: treat macOS and Linux as first-class targets from Phase 1 onward (tooling and packaging should support both).
- **Testing expectations**: aim for high-quality, meaningful coverage (unit + integration); use mocks for deterministic tests and supplement with optional LLM-in-the-loop smoke runs; no artificial 100% threshold.

> Pending answers feed back into the detailed sub-plans for each phase.

## Phase 1 – Core Orchestrator Foundation
Deliver `lorch run` with builder/reviewer/spec-maintainer agents, deterministic persistence, and resumable runs.

### P1.1 Milestone – Workspace & CLI Skeleton ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Tests first**: define unit specs for config generation/validation and golden snapshot for default `lorch.json`.
- **Task A**: scaffold Go module (`go mod init`), create `cmd/lorch` entrypoint with subcommands (`lorch`, `lorch run`, `lorch resume`). ✅
- **Task B**: implement bootstrap flow to detect/create workspace directories (`state/`, `events/`, `receipts/`, `logs/`, etc.). ✅
- **Task C**: implement config loader/auto-generator matching defaults (Claude agents, policy settings). ✅
- **Task D**: add validation layer (struct tags or JSON schema) with user-friendly errors. ✅
- **Exit criteria** ✅: tests from step one pass, CLI can initialize a fresh workspace, `lorch.json` matches expected golden file.

### P1.2 Milestone – Agent Supervisor & IPC Core ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Tests first**: craft mock-agent harness specs (echo NDJSON, heartbeat simulation) and scheduler sequencing tests.
- **Task A**: implement agent registry with subprocess lifecycle management (start/stop, restart hooks). ✅
- **Task B**: build NDJSON framing utilities (encoder/decoder, size enforcement, structured logging). ✅
- **Task C**: implement single-agent scheduler enforcing Implement → Review → Spec Maintenance order with back-pressure. ✅
- **Task D**: pipe transcripts to console and persist raw streams to `/events/<run>.ndjson`. ✅
- **Exit criteria** ✅: mock-agent tests pass; transcripts and event logs show correct sequencing.

### P1.3 Milestone – Idempotency & Persistence ✅ **COMPLETE**
> **Status**: Completed 2025-10-20
> **Summary**: Full implementation of idempotency keys, workspace snapshots, event ledger, run state persistence, and crash recovery via `lorch resume`. All core functionality tested and working end-to-end.

- **Tests first** ✅
  - Unit tests for canonical command hashing → deterministic idempotency keys.
  - Ledger append/replay tests (including checksum verification and out-of-order rejection).
  - Receipt-writing golden tests (JSON structure, checksum fields, atomic write behaviour).
  - Integration test simulating crash/restart with mock agents (re-run command with same IK, ensure no duplicates).
- **Task A – Idempotency Key Generator & Snapshot Metadata** ✅
  - Implement snapshot capture stub (record `snapshot_id`, placeholder hashes) invoked at run start.
  - Build canonical serialization + SHA256 hashing to derive IK per command (action/task/snapshot/inputs).
  - Persist snapshot metadata to `/snapshots/snap-XXXX.manifest.json` (minimal schema for now).
  - **Delivered**: `internal/idempotency`, `internal/snapshot`, `internal/checksum` packages with full test coverage.
- **Task B – Ledger Writer & Event Persistence** ✅
  - Extend event logging to append commands/events/heartbeats to `/events/<run>.ndjson` with metadata entries (timestamp, IK, checksum) as per spec §5.
  - Ensure append-only semantics, verify writes with checksum/hmac when reading.
  - Implement ledger reader that can reconstruct in-flight state on resume.
  - **Delivered**: `internal/ledger` package with replay logic and 256 KiB message support.
- **Task C – Receipt Pipeline** ✅
  - Write receipts to `/receipts/<task>/<step>.json` capturing artifacts, IK, message IDs.
  - Use atomic write pattern (tmp file + fsync + rename) and include SHA256 of artifact payloads (use `crypto/sha256`).
  - Add helper to compute file checksums for verification.
  - **Delivered**: `internal/receipt` and `internal/fsutil` packages with atomic write utilities.
- **Task D – Resume & Crash Recovery** ✅
  - Implement `/state/run.json` tracking run status, current stage, last message IDs.
  - On `lorch resume --run <id>`, reload state, replay ledger, send pending commands with original IKs.
  - Add crash simulation test: start run, stop mid-flight, restart via resume, ensure no duplicate work and consistent transcripts/ledger.
  - **Delivered**: `internal/runstate` package, `lorch resume` command, crash/restart integration tests.
- **Task E – CLI Wiring & Regression Harness** ✅
  - Wire `lorch run` to instantiate scheduler + supervisors, attach event logger/transcript formatter, and kick off Phase 1 pipeline using real components.
  - Provide flag/option to run with mock agents for local smoke tests (optional dev tool).
  - Update documentation (`README`, PLAN next steps) to reflect runnable path.
  - **Delivered**: Fully integrated `lorch run` command with snapshot capture, IK generation, and persistence.
- **Exit criteria** ✅ **MET**
  - All new tests (unit + crash/restart integration) pass. ✅ (~30 new tests, all passing)
  - Running `lorch run` produces event log, receipts, and snapshot metadata; resuming after simulated crash succeeds without duplicate work. ✅ (Verified end-to-end)
  - CLI transcripts/event logs align with spec formatting and content. ✅ (Matches MASTER-SPEC §5)

  - ✅ Spec-maintainer loop: spec.changes_requested with spec_notes artifacts, spec.no_changes_needed
  - ✅ Receipt tests verify test summaries and spec-note artifacts persist
  - ✅ Crash/resume test verifies granular spec loop continuation

- **Task A – Builder result contract enforcement** ✅
  - ✅ `validateBuilderTestResults()` helper in `scheduler.go:358-424`
  - ✅ Rejects builder completions without valid `tests` payload with clear error messages
  - ✅ Structured test metadata persisted in receipts and event log

- 📊 Implementation summary: `P1.4-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`

### P1.5 Milestone – QA, Packaging & Docs ✅ **COMPLETE**
> **Summary**: Release tooling, lint/test automation, and documentation landed. `lorch release` now builds cross-platform binaries with smoke validation; CI runs lint → unit → smoke pipelines, and docs cover usage through Phase 1.

- ✅ `lorch release` command builds darwin/linux (amd64 + arm64) binaries, writes `dist/manifest.json`, and records smoke outcomes per target (skipping non-native architectures when needed).
- ✅ `internal/release` package encapsulates manifest generation and smoke gating with unit coverage.
- ✅ `pkg/testharness` provides reusable binary builds and smoke scenarios; `TestRunSmokeSimpleSuccess` ensures mock-agent flows stay green.
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `golangci-lint`, `go test ./...`, and the smoke harness while archiving logs under `logs/ci/<run-id>/`.
- ✅ `.golangci.yml`, README quick start, `docs/AGENT-SHIMS.md`, and `docs/releases/P1.5.md` document tooling, shims, and release artifacts.

## Phase 2 – Natural Language Task Intake
Introduce the orchestration agent, add NL intake flows, and route approved plans into the existing implement → review → spec maintenance loop.

### P2.1 Milestone – Orchestration Agent Foundations
- **Tests first**: golden NDJSON fixtures for `intake`/`task_discovery` commands, heartbeat cadence validation, and deterministic file discovery snapshots.
- **Task A**: define orchestration agent contract in `internal/protocol` (schemas, enums, validation errors) including explicit payload slots for discovery metadata supplied by lorch; document semantics for `intake` (initial NL → tasks) vs `task_discovery` (incremental expansion) alongside action enums.
- **Task B**: scaffold `cmd/claude-agent --role orchestration` shim with env templating (`CLAUDE_ROLE`, workspace paths, log flags); clarify scope as a transport wrapper around the user-provided LLM CLI.
- **Task C**: add mock harness that replays scripted NDJSON transcripts for unit tests and local smoke runs.
- **Task D**: implement a deterministic file discovery service inside lorch (`internal/discovery`) that walks allowed paths (§10.4), ranks candidates, injects results into orchestration command inputs, and documents the determinism contract (sorted traversal, stable scoring, snapshot coupling).
- **Exit criteria**: shim can echo canned `orchestration.proposed_tasks` payloads with heartbeats under test, and the discovery service produces stable ranked outputs that match fixtures and published determinism notes.

### P2.2 Milestone – CLI Intake Loop
- **Tests first**: CLI interaction tests covering instruction prompt, cancellation, transcript streaming, and non-TTY behaviour (stdin fallback / failure modes).
- **Task A**: extend `lorch run` to detect missing `--task` and prompt for NL instruction (TTY prompt plus documented non-TTY behaviour).
- **Task B**: wire intake transcript streaming into console/logs while honoring heartbeat liveness checks.
- **Task C**: persist the raw intake conversation to `/events/<run>-intake.ndjson` with timing metadata.
- **Exit criteria**: manual smoke run shows prompt → intake transcript mirrored to console and events log; non-TTY path covered by automated test.

### P2.3 Milestone – Plan Negotiation & Approvals
- **Tests first**: orchestration loop tests covering `proposed_tasks`, `needs_clarification`, `task_discovery`, multi-candidate selections, and user decline flows.
- **Task A**: implement message router that relays orchestration envelopes (both `intake` and `task_discovery`) and enforces required responses.
- **Task B**: capture `system.user_decision` records (approve/deny/clarify) with correlation and persist to ledger + `/state/run.json`; ensure repeated clarifications reuse the original idempotency key with updated inputs.
- **Task C**: surface conflicts and clarifying questions to the user with clear retry/abort options, including numbered menus for multi-candidate approval and a "none" escape hatch.
- **Exit criteria**: approval loop records user decisions, handles clarifications with stable IKs, supports `task_discovery`, and exits cleanly on deny or "none" selection.

### P2.4 Milestone – Task Activation Pipeline
- **Tests first**: integration test driving orchestration output into builder/reviewer/spec-maintainer mocks, plus regression for `task_discovery` follow-up tasks.
- **Task A**: map approved plan objects into concrete task IDs, snapshots, and idempotency keys.
- **Task B**: enqueue tasks into the existing scheduler while preserving implement → review → spec-maintainer ordering and supporting additional `task_discovery` cycles mid-run.
- **Task C**: ensure receipts/artifact metadata reflect intake origin (task titles, rationale, discovery id) for traceability.
- **Exit criteria**: automated end-to-end test validates instruction → approval → implement/review/spec-maintainer completion with recorded traceability fields.

### P2.5 Milestone – UX Polish & Documentation
- **Tests first**: snapshot tests for console messaging, including conflict summaries, approval confirmations, and multi-candidate menus.
- **Task A**: refine copy for prompts, conflict surfacing, approval menus, and success summaries based on spec guidelines.
- **Task B**: update `docs/AGENT-SHIMS.md`, README, and new orchestration prompt template examples with shim scope, discovery behaviour, and mock mode usage.
- **Task C**: add regression tests for denied approvals, retry flows, and non-TTY intake to guard against future regressions.
- **Exit criteria**: documentation refreshed, UX copy stabilized, and regression suite green.

## Phase 3 – Interactive Configuration
Ship `lorch config`, validation enhancements, and flexible agent/tool settings.

- **Config editor**
  - Interactive TUI/CLI flow to edit `lorch.json` with immediate validation feedback.
- **Schema & compatibility checks**
  - Enforce versioning, detect deprecated keys, and surface warnings.
- **Extensibility hooks**
  - Support per-agent environment overrides, credential prompts, and toolchain presets without code changes.
- **Testing**
  - Unit tests for config transformations, compatibility migrations, and validation failure reporting.

## Phase 4 – Advanced Error Handling & Conflict Resolution
Improve diagnostics, recovery, and human control.

- **Enhanced telemetry**
  - Richer error codes, structured conflict reports, resource usage stats in heartbeats.
- **Automated recovery aids**
  - Guided suggestions when agents repeatedly fail, including surfacing conflict artifacts.
- **Spec-maintainer collaboration**
  - Better diff previews for SPEC.md updates, tools to accept/reject spec changes.
- **Testing**
  - Fault-injection tests to validate recovery workflows and human-in-the-loop escalation.

## Cross-Cutting Activities
- **Documentation**
  - Developer on-boarding guide, agent integration cookbook, and user-facing quick start.
- **Build & release tooling**
  - Reproducible builds, packaging for target platforms, and release checklist aligned with each phase.
- **Observation & metrics**
  - Plan for optional logging verbosity, trace IDs, and hooks for future analytics (without violating local-first goals).

## Next Steps
1. Draft Phase 2 intake UX specification (console prompts, approval loop, transcript expectations).
2. Prototype orchestration-agent shim contract updates (inputs/outputs, env vars) ahead of implementation.
3. Extend smoke fixtures to cover change-request iterations in preparation for Phase 2 regression coverage.

### Current Status (2025-10-20)
**Phase 1 Complete**: Milestones P1.1 through P1.5 are delivered with passing tests, release tooling, and documentation. The orchestrator now:
- Captures deterministic snapshots and idempotency keys.
- Schedules builder → reviewer → spec-maintainer loops with enforced test reporting and granular resume.
- Persists receipts, events, and run state for crash-safe restarts.
- Publishes cross-platform binaries (`lorch release`), smoke-validates them, and runs lint/unit/smoke checks in CI.
- Documents agent shims and release artefacts for local operation.

**Ready for Phase 2**: Natural Language Task Intake (orchestration agent + approval workflow).
