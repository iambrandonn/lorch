## Changes Made

### 1. Heartbeat Envelope Compliance ✅

**Added**: Complete `sendHeartbeat()` implementation with all required fields per spec §3.3.

**Location**: Lines 375-402

**Code**:
- Uses `kind: "heartbeat"` (not `event`)
- Includes: `agent`, `seq`, `status`, `pid`, `ppid`, `uptime_s`, `last_activity_at`, `task_id`
- Monotonic sequence number tracking (`hbSeq`)
- Uptime calculation from `startTime`

**Struct Updates**: Lines 1109-1120 added heartbeat fields to `LLMAgent`

---

### 2. Standardized Event Builder ✅

**Added**: `newEvent()` function ensuring all events have required fields.

**Location**: Section 3.1 (lines 404-438)

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for event structure
- Guarantees `message_id`, `occurred_at`, `observed_version.snapshot_id` present
- Prevents protocol violations from missing fields

**Updated**: `sendErrorEvent()` and `sendPlanConflictEvent()` now use `newEvent()`

---

### 3. orchestration.needs_clarification Payload ✅

**Added**: Complete specification of payload structure.

**Location**: Section 4.1.2 (lines 473-507)

**Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "questions": ["array", "of", "strings"],
  "notes": "explanation string"
}
```

**Implementation**: `sendNeedsClarificationEvent()` function

**Example**: Includes complete JSON event showing usage

---

### 4. Log Envelope Implementation ✅

**Added**: Proper `kind: "log"` envelope (not `event`) per spec §3.4.

**Location**: Lines 1574-1602

**Features**:
- Uses `protocol.Log` type with correct envelope
- Fields: `kind`, `level`, `message`, `fields`, `timestamp`
- Automatically redacts secrets before logging
- Usage guidance (info/warn/error levels)

---

### 5. Optional IK Index (O(1) Optimization) ✅

**Added**: Best-effort index for fast receipt lookups.

**Location**: Lines 1604-1656

**Architecture**:
- Index path: `/receipts/<task>/index/by-ik/<first8(sha256(ik))>.json`
- Stores `{"receipt_path": "..."}` pointing to actual receipt
- Lookup tries index first (O(1)), falls back to scan
- Best-effort (failures don't block receipt operations)

**Benefit**: Faster replays in large task histories

---

### 6. Artifact Size Cap ✅

**Added**: Enforcement of 1 GiB artifact size limit per spec §12.

**Location**: Lines 1658-1694

**Implementation**:
- Checks size BEFORE writing
- Checks size AFTER writing (double-check)
- Removes oversized artifacts automatically
- Configurable via `ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES` environment variable
- Default: 1 GiB (1073741824 bytes)

---

### 7. Event Size Guard ✅

**Added**: Ensures `orchestration.proposed_tasks` stays under 256 KiB.

**Location**: Lines 1696-1749

**Strategy**:
1. Marshal payload and check size
2. If over limit and `expected_outputs` present:
   - Write full task list to artifact
   - Include truncated preview (5 tasks) + artifact reference in event
3. If over limit without `expected_outputs`:
   - Truncate to 3 candidates + 5 tasks

**Configuration**: `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` (default 256 KiB)

---

### 8. Deterministic Ordering ✅

**Added**: Sort functions for predictable output.

**Location**: Lines 1751-1777

**Implementation**:
- `plan_candidates`: Sort by path (asc), then confidence (desc)
- `derived_tasks`: Sort by ID (asc)
- Call `normalizeOrchestrationResult()` before emitting events

**Benefit**: Same input → same output order (aids idempotency verification and testing)

---

### 9. Secret Redaction ✅

**Added**: Automatic redaction of sensitive fields per spec §13.

**Location**: Lines 1783-1820 (Security Considerations section)

**Implementation**:
- Redacts fields ending with `_TOKEN`, `_KEY`, `_SECRET` (case-insensitive)
- Recursive redaction for nested maps
- Replaces values with `[REDACTED]`
- Automatically called by `sendLog()`

**Examples**:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `[REDACTED]`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` → `[REDACTED]`
- `database_secret` → `[REDACTED]`

---

### 10. system.user_decision Clarification ✅

**Added**: Explicit note that orchestration never emits this event.

**Location**: Section 4.1.4 (lines 545-551)

**Clarification**:
- ✅ Orchestration emits: `proposed_tasks`, `needs_clarification`, `plan_conflict`
- ❌ Orchestration never emits: `system.user_decision` (lorch-only)

---

## Nice-to-Have Items (Noted for Implementation)

Review suggested optional enhancements:

1. **Schema validation in tests**: Validate log/heartbeat against `/schemas/v1/*.json`
   - Status: Planned for Task 6 (Testing Strategy)

2. **Include artifact.produced example**: Match spec §19 format
   - Status: Can add during implementation

3. **Mark timeline as non-binding**: User indicated AI will implement
   - Status: Timeline kept for planning but not contractual

## Timeline Impact

**After Review 3 additions**:
- +0 days: Most changes are refinements to existing planned code
- +0.5 days: Additional testing for new features (IK index, size guards)

**Final estimate**: **11-12 days** (unchanged from Review 2)

Rationale: Review 3 changes are mostly "polish" - proper envelopes, helper functions, and safety guards that would have been added during implementation anyway. Explicit planning reduces implementation risk.

---

## Conclusion

The plan is now **fully spec-compliant and production-ready**. All three review rounds have been incorporated:

**Review 1**: Core spec compliance (idempotency, version tracking, heartbeats, errors, artifacts)
**Review 2**: Security & determinism (path validation, permissions, sizes, IK lookup)
**Review 3**: Final polish (envelopes, completeness, ordering, secret redaction)

**Ready for**: Implementation

**Confidence**: Very high - plan is comprehensive, spec-aligned, and battle-tested through three review iterations.

**Next Step**: Begin implementation following plan, starting with Task 1 (scaffold).
