# Development Documentation

This directory contains internal development documentation for the lorch project, including implementation summaries, architectural decisions, and lessons learned from each development phase.

## Purpose

Development documentation serves to:
- **Preserve context**: Capture design decisions and their rationale
- **Enable onboarding**: Help new contributors understand how the system evolved
- **Support maintenance**: Provide reference when debugging or extending features
- **Document lessons**: Record what worked well and what to improve

## Organization

### Phase Summaries

Each phase/milestone has a consolidated summary document:

- **[phase-2.1.md](./phase-2.1.md)** - Orchestration Agent Foundations (P2.1)
  - Task A: Orchestration agent contract (protocol types)
  - Task B: Agent shim scaffolding (`claude-agent`)
  - Task C: Mock harness (`claude-fixture`)
  - Task D: Deterministic file discovery service
  - Integration examples for P2.2

More phase summaries will be added as development progresses.

### What's Included in Summaries

Each phase summary contains:
- **Overview**: What was built and why
- **Task breakdowns**: Detailed description of each task's deliverables
- **Key design decisions**: Architectural choices and their rationale
- **Testing approach**: Test coverage and verification methods
- **Integration points**: How the phase connects to future work
- **Lessons learned**: What worked well, improvements made
- **Deliverables**: Packages, binaries, tests, documentation created

### What's NOT Included

Phase summaries are consolidated views, not exhaustive logs:
- Intermediate review iterations (only final outcomes)
- Step-by-step implementation details (code is self-documenting)
- Routine bug fixes (unless architecturally significant)
- Process mechanics (git commits, tool usage, etc.)

## For Contributors

### Reading Documentation

**New to the project?** Start with:
1. Main `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
2. `MASTER-SPEC.md` - System specification
3. `PLAN.md` - Implementation roadmap
4. Phase summaries (this directory) - Understand what's been built

**Working on a feature?** Reference:
- The relevant phase summary for architectural context
- Code comments and package documentation
- `MASTER-SPEC.md` for protocol requirements

### Creating Documentation

When completing a phase/milestone, create a phase summary following this structure:

```markdown
# Phase X.Y Implementation Summary

**Milestone**: Name
**Completed**: Date
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview
[High-level summary of what was delivered]

## Task A: Name
### What Was Built
[Packages, types, features created]

### Key Design Decisions
[Architectural choices and rationale]

### Testing
[Test approach and coverage]

## [Additional tasks...]

## Integration Points for Next Phase
[How future work will use this phase's deliverables]

## Deliverables Summary
[Packages, binaries, tests, docs created]

## Lessons Learned
[What worked, what improved, technical debt]
```

See `phase-2.1.md` as a reference example.

## Archive Policy

**Keep**:
- ✅ Final phase summaries
- ✅ Architectural decision records
- ✅ Integration examples

**Can discard**:
- ❌ Intermediate review drafts (superseded by finals)
- ❌ Planning documents (after milestone completion)
- ❌ Temporary analysis or exploration notes

When in doubt, consolidate multiple documents into a single phase summary rather than keeping everything.

## Index

### Phase 1: Core Orchestrator Foundation
*Summary pending consolidation from P1.3-P1.5 implementation summaries*

### Phase 2: Natural Language Task Intake

- **[Phase 2.1: Orchestration Agent Foundations](./phase-2.1.md)** ✅
  - Orchestration protocol types
  - Generic agent shim (`claude-agent`)
  - Fixture-based mock harness (`claude-fixture`)
  - Deterministic file discovery service

- **[Phase 2.2: CLI Intake Loop](./phase-2.2.md)** ✅
- **[Phase 2.3: Plan Negotiation & Approvals](./phase-2.3.md)** ✅ (Summary; see [final review](./phase-2.3-review-final.md))
- **[Phase 2.4 Task A: Task Activation Mapping](./phase-2.4-task-a.md)** ✅
  - Activation pipeline: Intake approvals → concrete tasks → scheduler integration
  - Integration test validates orchestration → builder → reviewer → spec-maintainer
  - Validation framework with fail-closed decision handling
- **Phase 2.4 Task B/C: Scheduler Enqueueing & Traceability** (planned)
- **Phase 2.5: UX Polish & Documentation** (planned)

### Phase 3: Interactive Configuration
*(Not yet started)*
