# Phase 2.5 Task B – Documentation Updates

**Task**: Phase 2.5 Task B
**Completed**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Task B comprehensively documents Phase 2's Natural Language Task Intake features for both users and developers. The documentation spans user-facing guides (README, AGENT-SHIMS), technical references (ORCHESTRATION), practical examples (docs/examples/), and testing guidance (fixtures/README).

**Key Achievement**: Users can now understand and use NL intake from README examples, developers can implement orchestration agents from ORCHESTRATION.md, and contributors can test without LLM access using documented fixture patterns.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. README.md Updates ✅

**Added Section**: "Natural Language Intake" (45 lines)

**Content**:
- High-level workflow explanation (Prompt → Discovery → Orchestration → Approval → Execution)
- Interactive example session showing full intake flow
- Clarification and conflict handling summary
- Links to detailed documentation (ORCHESTRATION.md, AGENT-SHIMS.md)
- Fixture testing mention

**Location**: After "Quick Start", before "Release Builds"

**User benefit**: Immediate understanding of how to use `lorch run` without `--task` flag

---

### 2. docs/AGENT-SHIMS.md Major Expansion ✅

**New/Enhanced Sections**:

**A. Orchestration Agent (Natural Language Intake)** – 170 lines
- Purpose & scope (5-step workflow)
- Actions table (`intake`, `task_discovery`)
- Event types with payload structures:
  - `orchestration.proposed_tasks` (plan candidates + derived tasks)
  - `orchestration.needs_clarification` (questions + context)
  - `orchestration.plan_conflict` (conflicts + suggested resolution)
- Integration with file discovery (discovery metadata injection)
- Configuration example with timeout settings
- Testing with fixtures (bash examples, lorch.json config)

**B. File Discovery Behavior** – 60 lines
- Search algorithm (paths, exclusions, scoring heuristics)
- `heuristic:v1` scoring breakdown (filename tokens, directory location, depth penalty, heading matches)
- Example discovery output with score explanations
- Determinism guarantees (lexicographic traversal, stable ranking, version tagging)
- Integration notes (snapshot coupling, read-only metadata, task_discovery flow)

**C. Mock Agent Enhancements** – 40 lines

- Three approaches:
  1. Pure mock (mockagent for all roles)
  2. Claude-fixture (testing shim layer)
  3. Hybrid (real orchestration + mock execution)
- Writing custom fixtures (4-step process)
- Integration test pattern (Go code example)
- Fixture development workflow (5-step process from real LLM → fixture)

**Total addition**: ~400 lines of content

**Developer benefit**: Complete guide to implementing and testing orchestration agents

2. Clarification needed (ambiguous instruction)
3. Conflict detection (multiple plans)

**Testing**:
- Unit testing (isolated agent with test command)
- Integration testing (with lorch)
- Fixture-based testing (deterministic CI/CD)

**Best Practices**:
- Do/Don't lists (12 items)

### 5. testdata/fixtures/README.md Enhancement ✅

**Enhanced Section**: "Orchestration Fixtures" (expanded from 15 lines to 115 lines)

**New Content**:

**Creating Custom Orchestration Fixtures** (3 patterns):
1. Needs clarification flow (with example JSON)
2. Plan conflict flow (with example JSON)
3. Task discovery / "more options" (with example JSON, intake + task_discovery responses)

**Orchestration Event Requirements**:
- `proposed_tasks` field requirements
- `needs_clarification` field requirements
- `plan_conflict` field requirements
- Reference to docs/ORCHESTRATION.md

**Integration notes**:
- How clarifications are handled (same idempotency key)
- How conflicts are surfaced to users
- How task_discovery expands candidates

**Contributor benefit**: Clear guidance on creating orchestration test fixtures

## Documentation Quality

### Coverage

**User Documentation**:
- ✅ Quick start (README)
- ✅ Usage examples (README, examples/)
- ✅ Configuration (examples/README.md)
- ✅ Troubleshooting (AGENT-SHIMS, ORCHESTRATION, examples/)

**Developer Documentation**:
- ✅ Architecture (ORCHESTRATION.md overview)

### Consistency

**Terminology**: Aligned with MASTER-SPEC.md (§2.2, §10.2, §10.4)
- "orchestration agent" (not "NL agent" or "planning agent")
- "file discovery" (not "plan discovery" or "file search")
- "intake" action (not "ingest" or "process")

**Cross-References**: All internal links verified:
- README → ORCHESTRATION.md, AGENT-SHIMS.md
- AGENT-SHIMS → ORCHESTRATION.md, fixtures/README
- ORCHESTRATION → MASTER-SPEC, AGENT-SHIMS, protocol types
- examples/README → AGENT-SHIMS, ORCHESTRATION, fixtures/README

**Code Examples**: All examples tested:
- Bash commands: Valid syntax, correct paths
- JSON configs: Valid structure, correct field names
- Go code: Compiles, follows project patterns

---

## Testing

### Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ **File existence**: All referenced files exist (fixtures, binaries, docs)
2. ✅ **Link validation**: All internal links point to correct locations
3. ✅ **Example accuracy**: Fixture paths, command syntax verified
4. ✅ **Test suite**: `go test ./... -timeout 120s` passes (all packages)

### Regression Check

```
ok  	github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/internal/cli	12.049s
ok  	github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/pkg/testharness	32.263s
...
(all packages passed)
```

**Result**: ✅ No regressions introduced

---

## Integration with Future Phases

### Phase 2.5 Task C

Task C (regression tests) can reference:
- Fixture examples in testdata/fixtures/README.md
- Testing patterns in docs/AGENT-SHIMS.md
- Config examples in docs/examples/

### Phase 3 (Interactive Configuration)

Phase 3 `lorch config` can link to:
- docs/examples/ for configuration templates
- docs/AGENT-SHIMS.md for agent setup guidance

### Future Orchestration Agent Development

External contributors can:
- Follow docs/ORCHESTRATION.md to implement agents
- Use docs/examples/ for testing configurations
- Reference fixtures/README.md for fixture patterns

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Documentation structure**: Separating user (README), developer (ORCHESTRATION), and testing (AGENT-SHIMS) concerns kept each doc focused
2. **Examples directory**: Concrete configs are more useful than inline JSON snippets
3. **Fixture expansion**: Showing multiple patterns (clarification, conflict, discovery) helps contributors understand the protocol
4. **Cross-linking**: Consistent references between docs help readers navigate

### Improvements Made

1. **Original plan**: Create single ORCHESTRATION.md
   **Actual**: Distributed content across README, AGENT-SHIMS, ORCHESTRATION, examples/, fixtures/README
   **Rationale**: Better separation of concerns, easier to find relevant info

2. **Original plan**: "Brief" examples
   **Actual**: Comprehensive examples with full JSON structures
   **Rationale**: Copy-paste examples are more valuable than abbreviated snippets

3. **Original plan**: Focus on protocol
   **Actual**: Added LLM integration patterns, prompt templates, testing workflows
   **Rationale**: Real-world usage requires more than protocol spec
