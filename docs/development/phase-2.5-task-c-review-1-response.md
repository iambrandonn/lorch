# Phase 2.5 Task C Review Response

**Reviewer**: Codex (GPT-5)
**Developer**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: ✅ Issues Resolved

## Issue 1: Non-TTY Decline Test Hanging

**Original Finding**: `TestRegression_DeclineWithNonTTY` times out after 5s, suggesting a hang.

**Resolution**: ✅ Fixed

**Changes Made**:
1. Simplified test to use `runNonTTYIntake` helper directly (internal/cli/intake_regression_test.go:406-424)
2. Removed goroutine/channel complexity that may have caused race conditions
3. Added explicit verification that intake log was created (proves flow completed without hanging)
4. Validated with 3 consecutive test runs - all pass (0.43s, 5.44s, 0.44s average)

**Test Results**:
```bash
$ go test ./internal/cli -run TestRegression_DeclineWithNonTTY -v -count=3
--- PASS: TestRegression_DeclineWithNonTTY (0.43s)
--- PASS: TestRegression_DeclineWithNonTTY (5.44s)  # Build overhead
--- PASS: TestRegression_DeclineWithNonTTY (0.44s)
PASS
ok      github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/internal/cli       6.587s
```

**Root Cause Analysis**: The original test used a goroutine + 5s context timeout, which may have interacted poorly with the fixture binary build process on the reviewer's machine. The simplified version relies on go test's standard timeout (120s) and the helper's built-in error handling, making it more robust across environments.

## Issue 2: Orchestration Fixtures with Unsupported Retry Patterns

**Original Finding**: Fixtures `orchestration-clarification-then-conflict.json` and `orchestration-multiple-conflicts.json` use retry keys like `intake_retry_1`, but the fixture agent only looks up by action name.

**Resolution**: ✅ Fixed

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed unused fixtures**: Deleted both problematic fixture files
2. **Verified no usage**: Confirmed via grep that these fixtures were never referenced in tests
3. **Created documentation**: Added `testdata/fixtures/README-regression.md` explaining:
   - Which fixtures are actively used by which tests
   - Fixture agent limitations (action-based lookup only)
   - Guidance to use mock supervisors for multi-step scenarios

**Why These Fixtures Existed**:
During initial implementation, I created fixtures for all planned test scenarios. However, I discovered that multi-step scenarios (clarifications, conflicts, retries) require fine-grained control over event sequences and idempotency key verification. I converted those tests to use `fakeOrchestrationSupervisor` mock objects instead, which provide proper state management and sequencing. The unused fixtures were leftover artifacts that should have been removed before review.

**Active Fixtures** (all validated):
- `orchestration-simple.json` - Used by 7 tests
- `orchestration-discovery-expanded.json` - Used by 3 tests
- `orchestration-error-retriable.json` - Used by 1 test
- `orchestration-malformed-response.json` - Used by 1 test

**Mock Supervisor Tests** (11 tests using complex multi-step flows):
- TestRegression_DeclineAfterMultipleClarifications
- TestRegression_AbortDuringConflictResolution
- TestRegression_MultipleConflictResolutions
- TestRegression_ClarificationConflictApprovalFlow
- TestRegression_InvalidInputRetryLimit
- TestRegression_ResumeAfterPartialNegotiation
- TestRegression_NonTTY_WithClarifications
- TestRegression_NonTTY_WithConflictResolution
- Plus 3 others

## Final Validation

**Full Regression Suite**:
```bash
$ go test ./internal/cli -run "TestRegression_" -timeout 120s
ok      github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/internal/cli       31.881s
```

**All 21 regression tests passing** ✅

**Full Project Suite**:
```bash
$ go test ./... -timeout 120s
ok      github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/cmd/claude-agent   (cached)
ok      github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/internal/cli       (cached)
[... all packages ...]
ok      github.com/iambrandonn/lorch/pkg/testharness    32.146s
```

**No regressions** ✅

---

## Files Changed (Review Fixes)

1. **Removed**:
   - `testdata/fixtures/orchestration-clarification-then-conflict.json`
   - `testdata/fixtures/orchestration-multiple-conflicts.json`

2. **Modified**:
   - `internal/cli/intake_regression_test.go` (simplified `TestRegression_DeclineWithNonTTY`)

3. **Added**:
   - `testdata/fixtures/README-regression.md` (fixture documentation and usage guide)

---

## Summary

Both issues resolved:
- ✅ Non-TTY decline test now reliably passes without hanging
- ✅ Unused/broken fixtures removed, active fixtures documented
- ✅ All 21 regression tests passing
- ✅ Full test suite green (no regressions)

**Ready for approval** pending reviewer re-validation.
