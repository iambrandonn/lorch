# Review Summary

The follow-up resolves the resume-idempotency gap and closes out the earlier issues. Execution runs now persist the exact command inputs used during activation, which lets crash recovery replay identically.

# Findings

No outstanding findings. Resume now pulls the stored `current_task_inputs` map, ensuring the regenerated builder commands match byte-for-byte (same idempotency key). Snapshot updates, task tracking, and state-load validation all look good.

# Recommendation

Proceed with Phase 2.4 Task C. Consider adding an automated regression that simulates a crash mid-activation to guard the new `current_task_inputs` flow, but no blockers remain for task approval.
