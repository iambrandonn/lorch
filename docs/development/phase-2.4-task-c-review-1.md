# Phase 2.4 Task C – Review 1

**Reviewer**: Codex (LLM)  
**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Approved

## Findings
- Implementation extends `internal/receipt.Receipt` with intake lineage fields (`task_title`, `instruction`, `approved_plan`, `intake_correlation_id`, `clarifications`, `conflict_resolutions`) and wires them through `receipt.NewReceipt`, satisfying the traceability goal.
- `activation.Task.ToCommandInputs()` now surfaces `intake_correlation_id`; the scheduler preserves the full input map for builder/reviewer/spec commands so every receipt carries the same metadata.
- TR-001 integration test exercises the full intake → activation → scheduler flow with fixture agents and verifies the new receipt fields; additional unit tests cover helper extraction logic and backwards compatibility.
- No regressions spotted in existing activation or receipt helpers; legacy (non-intake) tasks degrade cleanly thanks to `omitempty`.

## Notes
- Event log and run-state traceability are still marked TODO elsewhere, but that work appears scoped to future tasks—no blockers for Task C completion.
