# Phase 2.5 Review – Unit Tests (Round 2)

**Reviewer**: Codex (GPT‑5)  
**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Scope**: Phase 2.5 “UX Polish & Documentation (Unit Tests)” follow-up

---

## Verdict
- Status: ✅ Approved
- Rationale: The previously identified gaps have been closed; the new tests now exercise the production helpers and verify the clarification retry flow.

---

## Findings

1. **Snapshot coverage now driven by production helpers** – `TestConsoleOutput_ApprovalConfirmation` and `TestConsoleOutput_DiscoveryMessage` invoke the real `printApprovalConfirmation` and `printDiscoveryMessage` helpers (`internal/cli/run.go:729-735`, `internal/cli/run.go:1738-1743`), ensuring the tests would fail if the user-facing copy regresses. ✅

2. **Clarification retry bug fixed and covered** – `promptClarifications` uses an index-based loop so empty answers retry the same question (`internal/cli/run.go:1185-1203`), and the new tests (`internal/cli/console_output_test.go:291-340`) confirm both single- and multi-question retry flows. ✅

---

## Notes
- `go test ./... -timeout 180s` still times out in `internal/supervisor` on my run (context deadline exceeded). This predates the Phase 2.5 changes but worth keeping an eye on before merging.
