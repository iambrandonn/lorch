# Phase 1.5 Implementation Summary

## Deliverables
- `lorch release` command with cross-compilation (darwin/linux, amd64/arm64), `--target` + `--skip-smoke` switches, and structured manifest output.
- `internal/release` package + tests covering manifest generation and smoke gating logic.
- Smoke harness (`pkg/testharness.RunSmoke`) and integration test that compiles local binaries, runs mock agents against fixture scripts, and validates receipts/runstate output.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running lint, unit tests, and smoke tests while persisting logs to `logs/ci/<run-id>/`.
- `golangci-lint` configuration (.golangci.yml) adopted across the repo.
- Documentation updates: README quick start, `docs/AGENT-SHIMS.md`, and `docs/releases/P1.5.md` release notes.
- Additional smoke scenarios covering reviewer and spec-maintainer change-request loops.

## Validation
- `golangci-lint run`
- `go test ./...`
- `go test ./pkg/testharness -run TestRunSmoke -v`
- `go run ./cmd/lorch release --target $(go env GOOS)/$(go env GOARCH) --skip-smoke`

## Follow-ups
- Integrate artifact checksum verification into CI once release artefacts are published.
- Extend manifest to capture additional metadata (build host, smoke transcript) as Phase 2 requirements land.
- Expand smoke coverage to builder failure scenarios and orchestration flows in Phase 2.
